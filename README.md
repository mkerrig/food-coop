### If you're not a dev, but want to change how the site looks:

### 1. Change the necessary HTML and other static files in `templates/` and `static/`
  * Test the your local version of the site by running `python food_coop.py` then open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser
  * Put all new static files in static, otherwise uploads won't work
  * To upload static files to our S3 bucket that you are referring to in the HTML run `python upload_static_resources.py`
  * Make the source links in the following format: static/INSERT-FILENAME-HERE

### 2. Make a pull request to this repo so I can upload your changes to the live site
